1.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added "minimumClusterSize" property (default: 0) specifying the minimum number
  of markers required within one cluster area to show the cluster icon instead
  of the markers themselves.
* Added "maximumZoomLevel" property (default: 20) specifying the maximum zoom
  level at which clusters should be formed. In zoom levels above the specified
  markers will be shown as they are.
* Fixed bug where re-assignment of markers to the map caused flickering when
  dragging the map.
* Improved handling of zoom level / map bounds changes. Moved createCluster()
  and showClustersInBounds() calls to draw method of projection overlay.
* Added new clear() method which removes all markers and clusters.
